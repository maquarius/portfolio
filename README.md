# About
My portfolio is written completely in JavaScript, HTMl and CSS. I chose explicitly not to use any libraries or such, because i wanted to try and perfect my coding skills and not rely on libraries too much.

Don't hesitate to send me a message if you liked my portfolio or if you have some improvement suggestions.
